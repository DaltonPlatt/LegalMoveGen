// D.A.G., 03/18/2012: timeman.cpp is intended to contain the code 
// having to do with time management. In a game with limited time
// for thinking, the program has to decide when to stop thinking
// and make the current best move. However, LegalMoveGen does not
// do that yet. Thus timeman.cpp merely provides system_time() 
// for void benchmark(int argc, char* argv[]) to invoke
// and measure how long its work takes.
#include "timeman.h"
using namespace std;

/// system_time() returns the current system time, measured in milliseconds

int system_time() {

#if defined(_WIN32) || defined(_WIN64)
  struct _timeb t;
  _ftime(&t);
  return int(t.time * 1000 + t.millitm);
#else
  struct timeval t;
  gettimeofday(&t, NULL);
  return t.tv_sec * 1000 + t.tv_usec / 1000;

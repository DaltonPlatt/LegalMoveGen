// D.A.G., 03/18/2012: timeman.h is a header for declarations 
// having to do with time management. In a game with limited time
// for thinking, the program has to decide when to stop thinking
// and make the current best move. However, LegalMoveGen does not
// do that yet. Thus timeman.h merely helps make sure that we can invoke
// system_time() in void benchmark(int argc, char* argv[]) 
// and measure how long the work of benchmark takes.
// It comes fifth in a series of headers: chess.h -> bitboard.h ->
// position.h -> search.h -> timeman.h -> (thread.h)...
